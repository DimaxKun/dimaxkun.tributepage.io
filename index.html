        <ul>
          <li><strong>2003</strong> - I was born in Antipolo Rizal, Manila on October 27.</li>

          <li>
            <strong>2016-2017</strong> - When I was 13 years old, I finally entered my high school era. This is where I finally noticed the difference in maturity of elementary & high school students.
